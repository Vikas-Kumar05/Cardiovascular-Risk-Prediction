# Problem Statement

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict wheater the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients' information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

# Introduction:

* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major cause of mortality worldwide. According to WHO, 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, accounting for 32% of all global fatalities.
* Though CVDs cannot be treated, predicting the risk of the disease and taking the necessary precautions and medications can help to avoid severe symptoms and, in some cases, even death.
* As a result, it is critical that we accurately predict the risk of heart disease in order to avert as many fatalities as possible.
* The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can predict if a patient is at risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) over the period of 10 years, based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical history.
